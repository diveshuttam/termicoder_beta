# # Browser to launch a problem null => default
# # example:
# browser: google-chrome
# # or
# browser: /usr/bin/some_browser
browser: null

# # Default file name extension for code
default_extension: cpp

# # Default code file name for non problem directories
default_code_file: a.cpp

# # Editor to launch a problem null => default
editor: null

# # Jinja style argument list substitutions are supported while
# # launching CODE_FILE in editor.

# # example for vim
# editor:
#   - vim
#   - +{{row_no}}

# # example for sublime
# editor:
#   - subl
#   - "{{CODE_FILE}}:{{row_no}}:{{col_no}}"

# # above is assuming: row_no OR col_no is defined with each of the templates.
# # You can also define variable on your own in code templates and use here
# # CODE_FILE is a special variable which can be used if CODE_FILE is not the
# # last argument. By default termicoder passes CODE_FILE as the last argument.
# # if {{CODE_FILE}} is used here it is just replaced and not PASSED extra.
