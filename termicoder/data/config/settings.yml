# Browser to launch a problem null => default
browser: null

# Default file name extension for code
default_extension: cpp

# Default code file name for non problem directories
default_code_file: a.cpp

# Editor to launch a problem null => default
editor: null

# # Jinja style argument list substitutions are supported
# # while launching code_file in editor.
# # example for vim
# editor:
#   - vim
#   - +{{row_no}}

# # example for sublime
# editor:
#   - subl
#   - "{{FILENAME}}:{{row_no}}:{{col_no}}"

# # assuming row_no is defined with each of the templates
# # you can define variable on your own in code templates and use here
# # FILENAME is a special variable which can be used if FILENAME is not the
# # last argument. By default termicoder passes FILENAME as the last argument
# # if {{FILENAME}} is used here it is just replaced and not PASSED
